            <h3>High School</h3>
                <p>After graduating from Teston, I attended high school at Maple High. I spent four year&rsquo;s here from 2016-2020. The school slogan was:
                <blockquote>
                "Working Together Toward Student Success"
                </blockquote>
                Some of the courses I took include:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Financial Accounting Principles</li>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Developed basic accounting knowledge</li>

                        <td>Financial Accounting Principles</td>
                        <td>Developed basic accounting knowledge</td>

                        <td>Developed a basic understanding about the Canadian and international legal system</td>
                    </tr>
                  </table>
    
    
                <p>Out of all the courses mentioned, the most notable to me was Intro to Computer Science. 
                This is because I was introduced to computer programming which I have found useful in my professional career. 
                With the entry level skills I acquired I was able to improve my resume and use the knowledge learned in university courses such as this one!</p>
    
                <p>Educational Awards: I was awarded the honour roll each year of high school. This was as a result of me achieving above 80% each semester.</p>
