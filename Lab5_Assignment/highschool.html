            <h3>High School</h3>
            <p>After graduating from Teston, I attended high school at Maple High. I spent four year&rsquo;s here from 2016-2020. The school slogan was:
            <blockquote>
            "Working Together Toward Student Success"
            </blockquote>
            Some of the courses I took include:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Financial Accounting Principles</li>

                    </ol type="a">
            </ol>

            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Course</th>

                <tr>

                    <td>Developed a basic understanding about the Canadian and international legal system</td>
                </tr>
              </table>


            <p>Out of all the courses mentioned, the most notable to me was Intro to Computer Science. 
            This is because I was introduced to computer programming which I have found useful in my professional career. 
            With the entry level skills I acquired I was able to improve my resume and use the knowledge learned in university courses such as this one!</p>

            <p>Educational Awards: I was awarded the honour roll each year of high school. This was as a result of me achieving above 80% each semester.</p>
