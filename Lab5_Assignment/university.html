            <p> The most notable course I have taken so far in my university career is ITM415. 
            This is because the concepts I learned in this course relating to business processes and how to model them was used in my recent Co-op role I had. 
            I was an IT intern at Green Infrastructure Partners and I was asked to model some of the IT processes we had in place.
            Using the BPMN knowledge I had developed at school, I was able to do the task with no issues.</p>

            <p>Educational awards: I was awarded an entry scholarship for academic achievement. This was as a result of my GPA exiting High School.</p>
