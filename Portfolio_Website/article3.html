            <h1>Ravens vs Bills</h1>

                <p><strong>This win? Yeah, this win felt like a win alright. </strong> In a Sunday Night Football matchup between two AFC heavyweights, it was the Ravens who came out on top - and quite convincingly so. Standout offensive performances from Derrick Henry, Lamar Jackson & Justice Hill saw the Ravens march through the Bills defense on route to putting up 271 rushing yards and 35 points. The defense also showed out and shut down the best offense in the league. The Bills, who had entered the game averaging a league leading 37.3 points a game, saw themselves held to just 10 points. It wasn't a perfect game by any stretch however. The Ravens continue to draw flags at an alarming rate, and Mark Andrews continues his worrying offensive play, having now gone back to back games without recording a single catch. </p>
                
                <p>The name of the game for the Ravens offence tonight was the run game. On their first play of the game they handed it off to Derrick Henry and the king sprinted 87 yards down the field into the endzone for a touchdown in what was also the longest run in Ravens history. Henry was a force throughout the game adding a receiving touchdown while putting up 209 all purpose yards. This marks back to back games of over 150 rushing yards and 2TDS for Henry who has put an end to the father time conversations. He wasn't the only running back of note for the Ravens tonight however with Justice Hill putting up a career game himself. He consistently broke off large plays, receiving the ball behind the line of scrimmage and finding holes in the bills defense. Hill put up a touchdown himself as a result of a 19 yard touchdown grab. This 1-2 punch can be a headache for opposing defensive coordinators to cover with Hills catching abilities complimenting Henrys hardnosed rushing attack. Jackson also played his part, though he refreshingly didn't need to take on the role of superman in this one. He managed the game well, passing the ball effectively when required, finishing with a 73% completion rate and the aforementioned two touchdown passes. He also contributed on the ground finishing with 54 yards and a touchdown.</p>
                
                <p>Though the Ravens blew out the Bills, there were still some issues to improve upon. While the offensive line look far improved from the first two weeks of the season, contributing with huge blocks such as on Henrys touchdown run by Roger Rosengarten (making his first career start at RT), and allowing no sacks on Jackson, there was also a ridiculous amount of holding calls and other such miscues. The Ravens continue to not only be among the most flagged team in football but they've drawn the most flags through these first four games in their entire history. These issues need to get sorted out and quickly as it is costing the Ravens critical yardage and potential points as a result. Mark Andrews also continued with his offensive woes dropping a wide open catch right after his understudy Isiah Likely made a huge grab the play prior. He now has 6 catches for 65 yards on the season and has put up back to back no reception games. While he does play an immense role for the Ravens with his blocking abilities, this lack of production is starting to become a major concern.</p>
                
                <p>The defense played a huge role tonight, as they never let the Bills fully into the game. The defensive line put constant pressure throughout on Allen and it saw him sacked three times throughout the game, one of them resulting in a recovered fumble, after only getting sacked twice in the three games prior. Kyle Van Noy put up two sacks, vaulting him into second place in the league with six sacks on the season. Multiple drives for the Bills ended in three and outs and they struggled to put up any points going into half having only put up a FG. Though there were some mishaps such as on a broken play seeing Josh Allen launch one deep to Khalil Shakir which set up a touchdown on the following play, the secondary stood strong shutting down Allen and his receivers. Allen was held to an abysmal 55% completion percentage and a measly 180 yards passing. Rookie cornerback Nate Wiggins also had a chance to grab two picks off Allen but unfortunately dropped both balls. Allen was eventually subbed out for backup Nathan Peterman late in the fourth putting an early end to his night.</p>

                <p>The Ravens finally played a complete game, holding onto their lead and not letting their opponent get back into the game. This is the type of play that they are capable of putting out - its just a matter of doing so consistently. When the team is firing on all cylinders as they were here, theres not a single team in the league capable of stopping them.</p>
