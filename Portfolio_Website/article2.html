            <h1>Leafs Opening Game</h1>
                <p><strong>It was an opening night to forget for the Toronto Maple Leafs</strong> as they suffered a 1-0 shutout against their longtime rivals, the Montreal Canadiens. It was the first time in 227 games that the Leafs failed to score a goal, though it wasn't for a lack of trying as they put up 47 shots on opposing netminder Sam Montembeault.</p>

                    <li>It was an unlucky night for the Leafs as they rang the post a combined 5 times. With the amount of offensive firepower they have it wont take long until one of those shots ends up of the back of the net</li>
                    <li>Cole Caufield was the lone scorer tonight, taking advantage on the powerplay in the first period which saw the Habs take a 1-0 lead which they would hold onto for the rest of the night</li>

                    <li>Coach Craig Berube:</li>
                        <li>On the game as a whole: "A lot of good things. A lot of shots. I thought the execution was off, whether it was the shot or the passing. It just wasn't clean enough at times, the power play included. But there was a lot of good stuff. When you almost get 50 shots on net and you don't scoreTheir goalie played well, but I was happy with our effort. The guys battled and worked. Stolarz was really good in net. A lot of good things, but we have to find a way to finish better."</li>
                        <li>On the Leafs powerplay: "Not direct enough. A little outside for me, you know? We didn't look to attack right away, get shots, and get pucks to the net to look for some rebounds. We were just moving it around on the outside too much. I don't want to call it 'too cute,' but we have to be more direct. That, too," said Berube on the PP.</li>
                        <li>On the Leafs penalties: "They were unnecessary penalties, some of them. We talked before the game and in between periods about it. We have to be better."</li>
