            <p>The Ravens first preseason game of the season is almost upon us as they take on the Philadelphia Eagles at the M&T Bank Stadium. Below, I list some of my pregame thoughts and predictions.

                Pregame thoughts:
                
                Question marks on the offensive line:
                
                Outside of earmarked starters at LT and C, there are spots up for grabs on this Ravens line. Right tackle Morgan Moses, Right Guard Kevin Zeitler and Left Guard John Simpson all departed this offseason. It will be interesting to see which players get most of the reps at those positions in this first game. Rookie second-rounder Roger Rosengarten is one to watch at the RT position as he battles with Patrick Mekari for the starting role. Andrew Vorhees at LG will also have the chance to make the position his own. Coming into the draft he was projected as a potential first-round pick before he tore his ACL. The Ravens took him in the 7th round and he now has the chance to show why he was so highly touted entering the draft.
                
                Who will emerge as the WR3?
                
                Zay Flowers and Rashod Bateman are penciled in as WR1 and WR2 respectively but the next man up could be up for discussion. Nelson Agholor is listed as the starter there but a strong preseason showing from rookie Devontez Walker could see him get bumped up the pecking order.
                
                Is Trenton Simpson up for the job?
                
                Arguably the biggest departure for the Ravens this offseason was Linebacker Patrick Queen, who after putting in a career year, has now signed in Pittsburgh with a three-year 41$ million dollar contract. The Ravens will now look to Trenton Simpson to fill the void alongside Roquan Smith. Entering into his Sophomore year he will need to be more than just serviceable if the Ravens wish to make a deep postseason run. A strong week 1 showing will help to alleviate any concerns.
                
                Prediction: I believe the Ravens will come away with a victory today behind good performances out of Devontez Walker and the Defense. Score: 24-10 Ravens
                
                Post-game roundup:
                
                Well, you get some things right and you get some things wrong. The Ravens lost the surprisingly competitive game 16-13. Below I list some of my takeaways from the game and review my predictions:
                
                Backup QB looking shaky
                
                As expected, reigning MVP Lamar Jackson did not start the game for the Ravens with veteran journeyman Josh Johnson playing the first half before being replaced by rookies Devin Leary and Emory Jones respectively. The offense looked shaky however with Johnson going 4/12 and no scores and Emory fumbling in his only drive of the game leading to the Eagle's walkoff FG. Devin Leary was the lone performer of the three going 6/10 alongside a rushing touchdown. Hopefully, things improve in the following three preseason games but the backup position looks bleak as things stand.
                
                Nate Wiggins' injury scare puts a damper on an amazing performance
                
                Wiggins, the Ravens first-round pick in this year's draft, started the game and put on a show. On the Eagles first drive, he had three pass breakups including forcing an incompletion on a fourth-down attempt. He continued his standout performance until he suffered a shoulder injury during the third quarter. Hopefully, this is nothing serious and he is good to go by next week's game.
                
                My pre-game predictions
                
                Roger Rosengarten and Andrew Vorhees got the majority of the starting reps for the Ravens at their respective positions and put in good performances with neither giving up a sack.
                
                Devontez Walker played very sparingly getting a single target and no catches. Hopefully, he gets ramped up and plays more as preseason progresses.
                
                Trenton Simpson shined as he led the Ravens defence with 11 tackles in the loss. It looks like the departure of Queen won't be as big of a loss as initially feared. Hopefully he can build on this performance and continue his good play in the coming weeks.
                
                The Ravens didn't end up winning this one in large part due to a sloppy offensive showing. The team had just 48 total offensive plays, getting only 11 first downs in the game compared to the Eagles 24 as well as going 2/12 on third downs. The time of possession was also greatly swayed in the Eagles favour as they had the ball for nearly 15 more minutes then the Ravens. The defence did as well as they could considering the lack of support they got from the offence and kept the game close until the last seconds of the game when the Ravens fumbled the ball in the Eagles half leading to Jake Elliot putting away a 49-yard FG to win the game.
                
                The Ravens will look to improve on this performance when they take on the Atlanta Falcons next week on Aug 17th.</p>
