                <h2>Pregame Thoughts</h2>
                <p><strong>Question marks on the offensive line:</strong> Outside of earmarked starters at LT and C, there are spots up for grabs on this Ravens line. Right tackle Morgan Moses, Right Guard Kevin Zeitler, and Left Guard John Simpson all departed this offseason. It will be interesting to see which players get most of the reps at those positions in this first game.</p>
                
                <p>Rookie second-rounder Roger Rosengarten is one to watch at the RT position as he battles with Patrick Mekari for the starting role. Andrew Vorhees at LG will also have the chance to make the position his own. Coming into the draft, he was projected as a potential first-round pick before tearing his ACL. The Ravens took him in the 7th round, and now he has the chance to show why he was so highly regarded entering the draft.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Who will emerge as the WR3?</strong> Zay Flowers and Rashod Bateman are penciled in as WR1 and WR2 respectively, but the next man up could be up for discussion. Nelson Agholor is listed as the starter there, but a strong preseason showing from rookie Devontez Walker could see him rise in the pecking order.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Is Trenton Simpson up for the job?</strong> Arguably the biggest departure for the Ravens this offseason was Linebacker Patrick Queen, who signed with Pittsburgh. The Ravens will now look to Trenton Simpson to fill the void alongside Roquan Smith. Entering his sophomore year, he will need to be more than just serviceable if the Ravens wish to make a deep postseason run. A strong Week 1 showing will help to alleviate any concerns.</p>

                <p>I believe the Ravens will come away with a victory today, behind good performances out of Devontez Walker and the defense. Score: 24-10 Ravens</p>

            <section class="postgame-roundup">
                <h2>Post-game Roundup</h2>
                <p>Well, you get some things right and some things wrong. The Ravens lost the surprisingly competitive game 16-13. Below are some takeaways from the game and a review of my predictions:</p>

                <p><strong>Backup QB looking shaky:</strong> As expected, Lamar Jackson did not start the game, with Josh Johnson playing the first half before rookies Devin Leary and Emory Jones took turns. The offense looked shaky, with Johnson going 4/12 and Emory fumbling in his only drive. Devin Leary was the standout, going 6/10 with a rushing touchdown. The backup position remains a concern as things stand.</p>

                <p><strong>Nate Wiggins' injury scare:</strong> Wiggins, the Ravens' first-round pick this year, had a great performance with three pass breakups before suffering a shoulder injury in the third quarter. We hope he’ll be ready for next week.</p>

                <p><strong>My pre-game predictions:</strong> Rosengarten and Vorhees performed well, with neither allowing a sack. Devontez Walker saw limited action with no catches. Trenton Simpson impressed with 11 tackles, showing he could fill Patrick Queen's role.</p>

                <p>The Ravens ultimately lost due to a sloppy offensive performance. They had just 48 offensive plays, going 2/12 on third downs. The Eagles controlled the clock, holding the ball for nearly 15 minutes more than the Ravens. The defense did well but couldn’t keep up as the offense struggled, leading to a last-second field goal for the Eagles.</p>
