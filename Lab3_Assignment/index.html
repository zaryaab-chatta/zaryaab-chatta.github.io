        <h3>High School</h3>
            <p>After graduating from Teston, I attended high school at Maple High. I spent four year&rsquo;s here from 2016-2020. The school slogan was:

                </tr>
              </table>


            <p>Out of all the courses mentioned, the most notable to me was Intro to Computer Science. 
            This is because I was introduced to computer programming which I have found useful in my professional career. 
            With the entry level skills I acquired I was able to improve my resume and use the knowledge learned in university courses such as this one!</p>

            <p>Educational Awards: I was awarded the honour roll each year of high school. This was as a result of me achieving above 80% each semester.</p>

            <p> The most notable course I have taken so far in my university career is ITM415. 
            This is because the concepts I learned in this course relating to business processes and how to model them was used in my recent Co-op role I had. 
            I was an IT intern at Green Infrastructure Partners and I was asked to model some of the IT processes we had in place.
            Using the BPMN knowledge I had developed at school, I was able to do the task with no issues.</p>

            <p>Educational awards: I was awarded an entry scholarship for academic achievement. This was as a result of my GPA exiting High School.</p>
