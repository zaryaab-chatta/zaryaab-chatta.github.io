        <h3>High School</h3>
            <p>After graduating from Teston, I attended high school at Maple High. I spent four year&rsquo;s here from 2016-2020. The school slogan was:
            <blockquote>
            "Working Together Toward Student Success"
            </blockquote>
            Some of the courses I took include:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Financial Accounting Principles</li>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>Developed basic accounting knowledge</li>
                    </ol type="a">

            </ol>
            <p>Out of all the courses mentioned, the most notable to me was Intro to Computer Science. 
            This is because I was introduced to computer programming which I have found useful in my professional career. 
            With the entry level skills I acquired I was able to improve my resume and use the knowledge learned in university courses such as this one!</p>

            <p>Educational Awards: I was awarded the honour roll each year of high school. This was as a result of me achieving above 80% each semester.</p>

        <h3>University</h3>
            <p>I am currently attending University at Toronto Metropolitan University. I am now in my fifth year here having started in Fall 2020. 
            I am expecting to graduate this coming June 2025.</p>
            <p>Some of the courses I have taken to date include:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>ITM 415 - Business Process Management</li>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>Learned about modeling business processes using Business Process Modelling Notation (BPMN)</li>
                    </ol type="a">
                <li>ITM 820 - Information Systems Security and Privacy</li>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>Learned about industry best practices relating to computer security</li>
                    </ol type="a">

                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>Covered the fundamentals of programming going over arrays, loops, validation, etc</li>

            </ol>
            <p> The most notable course I have taken so far in my university career is ITM415. 
            This is because the concepts I learned in this course relating to business processes and how to model them was used in my recent Co-op role I had. 
            I was an IT intern at Green Infrastructure Partners and I was asked to model some of the IT processes we had in place.
            Using the BPMN knowledge I had developed at school, I was able to do the task with no issues.</p>

            <p>Educational awards: I was awarded an entry scholarship for academic achievement. This was as a result of my GPA exiting High School.</p>
