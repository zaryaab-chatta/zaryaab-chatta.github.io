            <h2>Search Engine Optimization (SEO) Techniques</h2>
            <p>Using meta descriptions is an essential SEO technique. A meta description provides a summary of a webpage's content, appearing in search engine result pages (SERPs). This helps attract users by offering a clear and concise description of the webpage’s purpose. For example, a well-crafted meta description can increase click-through rates significantly (Moz, 2023).</p>
            <p>Incorporating relevant keywords into the webpage’s content and heading tags ("h1", "h2") is another SEO technique. Search engines use these keywords to rank pages, making them a crucial element in improving visibility. For instance, using specific keywords related to your niche can help you appear in targeted searches (Google, 2023).</p>
            <p>Validating HTML and CSS code ensures that the webpage is error-free and easily processed by search engine bots. While not directly impacting rankings, clean code improves loading speed and enhances user experience, indirectly benefiting SEO (W3C, 2023).</p>

            <h2>Social Media Optimization (SMO) Techniques</h2>
            <p>Adding social media buttons like a "Facebook Like" or "Share" button increases a webpage's visibility on social platforms. These buttons make it easy for users to share content, driving traffic and boosting engagement (Bhargava, 2010).</p>
            <p>Creating Instagram-specific content and embedding it on your webpage fosters user interaction and brand loyalty. Instagram is highly visual, making it ideal for promoting products or services creatively (Lockard, 2023).</p>
            <p>Using hashtags in embedded social media posts is another SMO technique. Hashtags categorize content, making it easier for users to find related posts. This can increase a page's reach significantly (Smith, 2022).</p>

            <h2>SEO Techniques Used</h2>
            <p>Three primary SEO techniques were implemented in the making of this webpage:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Meta Description:</strong> A meta description was added in the `<head>` section of the HTML. This provides a concise summary of the webpage's purpose to search engines, improving the likelihood of clicks in search results.</li>
                <li><strong>Keywords:</strong> Relevant keywords, such as "SEO," "SMO," and "web design," were included in the `<meta>` tag to help search engines identify the topic of the webpage.</li>
                <li><strong>Heading Tags:</strong> Structural heading tags  ("h1", "h2") were used throughout the document to organize content hierarchically. This makes the page more readable for users and improves its SEO ranking.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These techniques help ensure the webpage is both user-friendly and optimized for search engine visibility.</p>
