            <h2>Search Engine Optimization (SEO) Techniques</h2>
            <p>On-page SEO involves optimizing the content and structure of a webpage to make it more visible to search engines. This includes adding relevant keywords, improving meta descriptions, and enhancing site usability. These optimizations help search engines rank pages higher and provide users with valuable content (SEO Resellers Canada, 2024a).</p>

            <h2>Social Media Optimization (SMO) Techniques</h2>
            <p>Using hashtags effectively is a vital SMO strategy. Hashtags function as the SEO of social media platforms, boosting your contentâ€™s visibility by categorizing it into relevant topics. Twitter posts with one to two hashtags perform best, while Instagram posts see optimal engagement with around 11 hashtags. Adapting your hashtag use for each platform ensures maximum reach and effectiveness (eClincher, 2024a).</p>

            <p>Creating high-quality, problem-solving content attracts and engages audiences while fostering brand loyalty. This content could take the form of infographics, tutorials, or emotionally resonant posts. Providing clear and valuable solutions to your audience's challenges not only improves engagement but also strengthens your social media presence (eClincher, 2024b).</p>

            <p>Leveraging user-generated content (UGC) is another impactful SMO strategy. Encouraging customers to share photos, reviews, or videos about your brand builds trust and authenticity. UGC serves as social proof, demonstrating the value of your offerings and enhancing your connection with the community (eClincher, 2024c).</p>

                <li><strong>Keywords:</strong> Relevant keywords, such as "SEO," "SMO," and "web design," were included in the `<meta>` tag to help search engines identify the topic of the webpage.</li>
                <li><strong>Heading Tags:</strong> Structural heading tags  ("h1", "h2") were used throughout the document to organize content hierarchically. This makes the page more readable for users and improves its SEO ranking.</li>
